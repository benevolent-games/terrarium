// TODO move any code that isn't actually used in the demo,
//   into this archive folder.

- typescript ignores everything in this folder
- that way, it won't throw any errors or interfere with the working code
- so basically, we can just throw any code we don't use or understand into this
  directory, and stop thinking about it -- but it's readily available in case
  we need to ressurect it.
